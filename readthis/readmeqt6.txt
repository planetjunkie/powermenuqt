Hi, make sure to read this before executing this :)


requirements:
- PyQt6
- Python3
- Pip package manager

if they fit your requirements then go to your terminal, and type "pip install -r requirements.txt", and afterwards just type in "python3 main.py" and kaboom, you are done! it would be nice if you made a shortcut for the powermenu I developed for convinence, but have fun with this :D

(this software was made for linux)
